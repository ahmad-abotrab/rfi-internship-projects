## Files in this Repository

- `General_Education_School.xlsx`: The main dataset in Excel format.
- `General_Education_School.csv`: The same dataset in CSV format for easier data manipulation.
- `analysis.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing all data analysis steps, visualizations, and findings.
- `School_Analysis_Report_AR.docx.pdf`: A PDF report summarizing the key findings and recommendations (in Arabic).
- `README.md`: This file, describing the project and summarizing the work.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Importing the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring data quality.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generating descriptive statistics, visualizations, and identifying key trends.
3. **Insights and Findings**: Highlighting important patterns, correlations, and anomalies in the data.
4. **Reporting**: Summarizing the results in a clear and actionable format, with visual aids and recommendations.

## How to Use

1. Open `analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
2. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
3. Review the PDF report for a summarized version of the findings.
